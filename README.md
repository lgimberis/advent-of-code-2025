These are my personal solutions to this year (2025)'s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025). Unless otherwise stated, I reached the solution in each case by myself with no or minimal outside assistance.

After using 2024's to learn Rust, I have barely used it since... so I guess it's back to it.
